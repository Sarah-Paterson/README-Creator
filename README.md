# README Creator

## Description

In this project, I worked with existing code provided by The Coding Bootcamp on GitLab. I was motivated to create an index.js that can produce a README.md with prompts in the terminal.

This website was created for the purpose of giving the user a simplified way to create a README file for their projects. It provides the opportunity to write in the content information for their README without having to format it.

Through the process of coding the README creator JavaScript, I was able to learn more about node and inquirer.

[Here is a link to the video showing how it is used](https://youtu.be/MJoo9TuMnrY).

## Installation

In order to run this program, the user will have to have node.js installed on their device. Once that is complete, then using *node i* in the terminal will download the necessary inquirer for the program to run as intended.

## Usage

To use the README creator, start with node index.js. From here the user will be prompted to answer a series of questions for their README.
Once all the questions are answered, a README.md file will be created using the answers provided.
