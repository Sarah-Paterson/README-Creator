# README Creator
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
In this project, I worked with existing code provided by The Coding Bootcamp on GitLab. I was motivated to create an index.js that can produce a README.md with prompts in the terminal. This website was created for the purpose of giving the user a simplified way to create a README file for their projects. It provides the opportunity to write in the content information for their README without having to format it. Through the process of coding the README creator JavaScript, I was able to learn more about node and inquirer.
